::Essential Commands for working with Github::


01. Create a new repository (Ex: test) in GitHub
Link to this repository will be: https://github.com/arunrn/test.git


02. Go to your project folder (localhost) and initialise git for this project
Command: ~/Project$  git init


03. Next, we have to make sure that the GitHub files and the localhost Project folder are in sync (download and sync)
a) Create a remote
Command: ~/Project$ git remote add git-site https://github.com/arunrn/Project.git

b) Download online files to your localhost
Command: ~/Project$ git fetch git-site

c) Sync newly downloaded files with localhost project folder
Command: ~/Project$ git merge git-site/master

Now the Github files would be in sync with your localhost project folder (but not necessarily vice versa, you could still have lots of files locally that needs to be synced online, which we will be doing next).


04. Sync localhost project files with Github (upload and sync)
a) Add files for committing 
Command: ~/Project$ git add *

b) Commit changes
Command: ~/Project$ git commit -m 'Comments for this commit go here'

c) Sync these changes to online version (upload)
Command: ~/Project$ git push git-site master
